## Mastering Python Unit Testing with Boto3 
Advanced strategies for mocking AWS SDK & API Calls

<br>
    
## Abstract (150-250 words)


{{What problem does this talk address? What will attendees learn? }}

```md
**Example**

Integrating with AWS services through Boto3 is easy — testing that integration properly is not. Many teams end up with slow, brittle tests that hit real AWS accounts, require complex setup, or get skipped entirely.

This talk presents a practical, developer-friendly approach to testing Python projects that rely on AWS. We’ll start by identifying common anti-patterns (hardcoded clients, hidden network calls, untestable functions) and show how small design choices can make cloud code dramatically easier to test.

From there, we’ll walk through different testing strategies:

- Unit testing with botocore.stub.Stubber for precise, fast, low-level control
- Service mocking with moto for higher-level behavioral tests
- When (and how) to safely use real AWS in integration tests
- How to structure your code so AWS is a dependency, not a roadblock

Attendees will leave with concrete patterns, example test structures, and a clear mental model for choosing the right testing approach depending on risk, speed, and confidence needed.

Modern [problem space] often feels like [relatable pain point]. Teams struggle with [specific challenges], leading to [consequences: bugs, slow delivery, burnout, etc.].

In this talk, we’ll explore [your main topic/approach] and how it helps [who it’s for] achieve [key outcome]. You’ll learn [2–4 concrete things they’ll walk away with].

Through [demos / real-world examples / case study / lessons learned], we’ll break down [complex idea] into practical techniques you can apply immediately—whether you’re working with [tools/stack] or just trying to build more [quality: scalable, maintainable, secure, etc.] systems.
