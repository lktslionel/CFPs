## Building Universal CI/CD Pipelines
#### An idea around building an ubiquitous CI/CD Pipeline

Everyday as a DevOps Engineer, we are tasked to create/maintain CI/CD pipelines which help streamline software delivery and continuously improve software quality. And what I realized is, from company to company, we are — actually — doing the same things over and over but naming things differently; this, by always reinventing the wheel. 

What if I told you that I finally come up with a ubiquitous way of building CI/CD pipelines. Pipelines that do what there are suppose to, with, on one hand the right semantics, and on the other hand, with less grip at any CI/CD platform.

Together we will explorer that idea and try to build together the vision of a universal, semantically correct, and platform agnostic CI/CD pipeline.


## Summary

At the end of the talk, the attendees will — not only — learn a new way of building CI/CD pipelines, but they will participate/contribute in a disruptive practices in the software delivery industry.
