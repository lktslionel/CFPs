## Building Universal CI/CD Pipelines
#### An idea around building an ubiquitous CI/CD Pipeline

Everyday as a DevOps Engineer, we are tasked to create/maintain CI/CD pipelines which help streamline software delivery and continuously improve software quality. And what I realized is, from company to company, we are — actually — doing the same things over and over but naming things differently; this, by always reinventing the wheel. 

What if I told you that I finally come up with a ubiquitous way of building CI/CD pipelines. Pipelines that do what there are suppose to, with, on one hand the right semantics, and on the other hand, with less grip at any CI/CD platform.

Together we will explorer that idea and try to build together the vision of a universal, semantically correct, and platform agnostic CI/CD pipeline.

## Elevator Pitch 

I’m so exited to share with you the vision behind building universal, semantically correct, and platform agnostic CI/CD pipelines; along with how we can, with the tools we have at our disposal today — make this vision a reality. Though, to ensure that your company is aware and have a better understanding of your value delivery chain. Not to forget how you can improve it with less grip at any continuous delivery platforms.
I'm really looking forward to this discussion and hope you all enjoy the conference.
