### Abstract

Ansible is the simplest way to automate apps and IT infrastructure. Application Deployment + Configuration Management + Continuous Delivery.

It brings the concept of **roles** that help classify your automation tasks/playbooks and group them by purpose. 

But : 

* When should we use ansible roles ? 
* How to create and test ansible roles ? 
* What tools to we have to ease the process ? 
* How can we apply best practices of software development (TDD) to ensure your roles are doing what they are intended to ?

This talk will introduce you to Ansible Roles testing will Ansible Molecule; a tool use to drive ansible roles testing. 
Moreover, we will try to apply the Test Driven Development (TDD) process to test our roles.

So, come and see us, to learn more about Ansible and Ansible Roles Testing.
