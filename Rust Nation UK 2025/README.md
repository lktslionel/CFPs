# A Beginner's Journey to Intelligent Personal Finance Data Processing in Rust

## Elevator Pitch 

Join me as I share my journey from Rust novice to building a system that transforms bank statements into structured data using Rust, Adobe PDF Services, and local LLMs. This talk shows how beginners can harness Rust’s power to create advanced data processing pipelines.

## Abstract

Join me as I share my journey from Rust novice to building a system that transforms bank statements into structured data using Rust, Adobe PDF Services, and local LLMs. This talk shows how beginners can harness Rust’s power to create advanced data processing pipelines.

## Summary

In this presentation, I’ll guide you through my experience of learning Rust while developing an intelligent personal finance data processor. The system I created:

* Ingests PDF bank statements
* Extracts relevant financial information using Adobe PDF Services
* Utilizes a local LLM for intelligent data interpretation and categorization
* Transforms raw data into structured, ledger-ready formats

**Key topics I’ll cover includes but are not limited to :**

* Why Rust was the perfect fit for data processing task
* Integrating Adobe PDF Services with Rust for efficient PDF handling
* Implementing and leveraging a local LLM for smart data extraction and categorization
* Challenges faced while building this system
* Best practices and tools that sped up my learning and made the system a joy to build and use
* The privacy implications of processing financial documents
* Techniques for minimizing data exposure when using third-party APIs
* More
